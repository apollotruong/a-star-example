# a-star-example

## Description
WIP coding example!
This is a coding example based on the algorithm from 

`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm`

## Preview

![example](example.png)

The A* algorithm in this implementation assumes the **Top-left** is the **start** and the **Bottom-right** is the **goal**

***NOTE:*** The grid is **RANDOMLY** generated. So sometimes the result will be a "no solution" and stop the algorithm. Just click "Restart" for different versions!

## Installation
You can run this by:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/apollotruong/a-star-example.git
```
## Usage
Then open `~/a-star-example/index.html`
